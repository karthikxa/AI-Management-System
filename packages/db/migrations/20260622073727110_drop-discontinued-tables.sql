-- Centralize on zed.ts (85 tables) as the single source of truth. These 8
-- tables are discontinued: absent from prod, zero code references, and not
-- modeled in zed.ts. Their only foreign keys are internal to this set
-- (executions -> triggers, vault_item_grants -> vault_items), so nothing kept
-- depends on them. Dropping aligns dev + a fresh baseline build to prod, which
-- is exactly what zed.ts already models.

-- Down Migration
-- Forward-only: these tables are discontinued and intentionally not recreatable.
